We thank the referee for a fast and competent review. We are happy to address the concerns raised in this new version of our submission. All significant changes (beyond simple typos) are marked in bold font, any exception is discussed in the reply below. We add in our responses below in between the 

>>> While the paper states that there is now this one-to-one correspondence between X-ray emission and C III and O VI lines for the full set of stars, there is very minimal discussion about it. Additional columns in Table 3 with the line fluxes for each star should be added. Further, any specific trends that are found with these new CHANDRA measurements should be discussed and a plot with this information should be shown.

>>> The other main conclusion drawn from this work revolves around the detection of X-ray emission from an A star with Teff > 8200 K. Since the result is dependent on this parameter, there needs to be a more thorough look at what the actual temperatures of these stars are. Specifically for this edge-case star, tau3 Eri, the referenced literature value gives an effective temperature of 8210 K, however, there are more recent literature values of lower temperatures (7855-8091 K) that would alter the conclusions drawn from this work (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...591A.118S/abstract). This should be addressed in the text (e.g. lines 170 and 234) and the full range of possible Teff values should be listed in Table 3 and plotted as error bars in Figure 2.


-The authors should strongly consider a new title. The current one is confusing and does not adequately describe the work presented in the manuscript.

-Table 3 is missing error margins on the Teff, vsini, and Lx measurements. Since all stars in Table 3 are plotted in Figure 2 against Teff, please also include those temperature ranges in the table.

>>> -Line 31: please quantify what is meant by "most." What is the approximate percentage of the sample?

We don't really know the approximate percentage, thus the soft wording "most". Only a very small fraction of A and really B-type stars that are X-ray detected in RASS has been followed up with Chandra. In the Stelzer paper we cite, they observed just 5 stars. In three of them the X-ray are clearly coming from the resolved companion. In the remaining two, the X-ray properties are similar to the resolved companion, indicating that they might be coming from a companion that is unresolved even by Chandra - and indeed one of the two systems is a known spectroscopic binary. That puts the rate to 60-100%. However, the sample is small and they might be some bias that comes in from the sample selection. 
Huelamo et al. (2000) compare the ROSAT hardness from resolved companions with emission from stars that do not have a resolved companion and conclude that "the presence of an unresolved late-type companion seems to be the source of this emission" but the limited spatial resolution of ROSAT and selection of study targets from a known binary catalog are potential problems. The article itself does not attempt to quantify a fraction. We've added a some detail to the text, but we want to keep this discussion short, since we concentrate on close, well-studies stars exactly because of the problem of unresolved binaries.

>>> -Line 40 / 232: the reference for the formation temperatures of C III and O VI should be moved to the first mention of these values.

While the numbers T=50000 and T=300000 K are given in the Simon et al reference, it would probably be better to refer to an atomic database here. We added a citation to CHIANTI in the old line 40 (line numbers might differ in the new version of the manuscript). While the CHIANTI citation is newer than the Simon et al work, the temperatures at which those lines peak are still the same. For atomic data, we generally consider it best practice to check with the most recent atomic data and then refer the reader to that.
The Simon et al reference is for "C III and O VIII lines". We moved that reference before the temperatures to avoid confusion.

>>> -Line 114: typo "here to similar" -> "here to be similar"

In this sentence we simply wanted to say that we compare values obtained in this work ("here") to literature values. We re-worded that sentence.
