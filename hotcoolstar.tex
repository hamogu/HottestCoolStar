%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[preprint2]{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%%
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands.
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are
%% commented out).
%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.

%% The following section outlines numerous optional output that

%% This is the end of the preamble.  Indicate the beginning of the

\begin{document}

\title{How hot can cool stars be?}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\begin{abstract}
Cool stars on the main sequence generate X-rays from coronal activity, powered by a convective dynamo. With increasing temperature, the convective envelope becomes smaller and X-ray emission fainter. We present Chandra/HRC-I observations of four single stars with early A spectral types. The coolest star of this sample, $\tau^3$~Eri, is detected with $\log(L_X/L_\mathrm{bol})=-7.6$, while $\delta$~Leo, $\beta$~Leo, and $\iota$~Cen remain undetected with upper limits $\log(L_X/L_\mathrm{bol})<-8.5$. The drop in X-ray activity thus occurs a in very narrow range of no more than $\Delta T_\mathrm{eff}=200$~K and matches the end of activity in the \ion{C}{3} and \ion{O}{6} transition region lines.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Stars across the main-sequence (MS) produce X-ray emission in two fundamentally different mechanisms. Cool stars have convective envelopes, 
which can produce differential rotation and convective turbulence, giving rise to strong magnetic fields through the dynamo mechanism \citep{2017LRSP...14....4B}. These magnetic fields then help sustain the coronal activities around these stars.
Essentially all close-by late-type stars are X-ray emitters \citep{2004A&A...417..651S}. On the other end of the MS the most massive stars have fast winds. Instabilities in the winds heat the gas to a few MK. Again, nearly all of them are X-ray emitters \citep{1996A&AS..118..481B,1997A&A...322..167B}. Stars from mid-A to B operate neither mechanism: Their winds are too weak to produce detectable X-ray emission and their atmospheres are radiatively dominated and do not drive a turbulent convective dynamo. Mid-A to B-type stars thus are X-ray dark \citep{1997A&A...318..215S}.

Nevertheless, some A and B-type stars  are seen in the ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS) or in other X-ray datasets \citep{2020ApJ...902..114W}, because they often have unresolved late-type
companions. Due to the shorter lifetime of the A-type star, the companion is
still at an early stage of its evolution when the A-star is on the MS and thus the companion is X-ray bright. The RASS
catalog contains 312 bright A-type stars. This is a detection rate of 10-15\% \citep{2007A&A...475..677S}.  Closer examination confirms that most of these sources turn out to be multiple \citep{2000A&A...359..227H,2003A&A...407.1067S}.

However, star spots with a low amplitude 0.05\% have been found on Vega \citep{2015A&A...577A..64B} together with a weak (disk-averaged line-of-sight component $< 1$~G) magnetic field \citep{2009A&A...500L..41L,2010A&A...523A..41P}.
Also, recent studies with \emph{Kepler} and \emph{TESS} do indeed find rotational modulation of early A-type stars \citep{2011MNRAS.415.1691B,2017MNRAS.467.1830B,
2019MNRAS.487.4695S} and sometimes signatures of what seem to be magnetic flares \citep{2012MNRAS.423.3420B}. However, the latter can usually be attributed to binarity or artifacts such as contamination of the lightcurve by nearby sources \citep{2017MNRAS.466.3060P}.

\cite{2002ApJ...579..800S} systematically observed mid-A type stars in the UV
looking for the subcoronal emission lines
of C\,{\sc iii} and O\,{\sc vi} formed between 50,000 and 300,000~K. They find a
very sharp cut-off, where stars with $T_\mathrm{eff}<8200$~K have line fluxes similar to our Sun (normalized to the bolometric
luminosity), but these lines are undetected in stars with $T_\mathrm{eff} > 8300$~K. It seems that the
transition between stars with and without a corona happens within 100~K and that the cut-off temperature is compatible with theoretical predictions \citep{2000ASPC..210..187C,2002MNRAS.330L...6K}.

\citet{2002ApJ...579..800S} also analyzed archival \emph{ROSAT} observations
and find X-ray emission only for stars below 8200~K. However, the X-ray sensitivity was not very high by modern standards. 
In this paper, we present new \emph{Chandra}/HRC-I observations that are about an order of magnitude more sensitive. \citet{2008ApJ...685..478N} extend the list of UV observations and do find  C\,{\sc iii} and O\,{\sc vi} in hotter sources, however, in those cases, the emission is better explained by late-type companions.
To avoid the problem of unresolved companions, we concentrate on well-studied A stars within 30~pc, where spectroscopy and recent planet searches with the radial-velocity method \citep[e.g.][]{2021AJ....161..157H}, direct imaging \citep[e.g.][]{2013ApJ...776....4N,2017AJ....154..245M}, and the study of anomalous GAIA proper motion \citep{2019A&A...623A..72K} essentially rule out the presence of a late-type stellar companion.

There are two special classes of A-type stars where X-ray emission is commonly observed: (1) Chemically peculiar Ap \citep{1997A&A...323..121B,2011A&A...531A..58R} stars have magnetic fields presumably strong enough to funnel a wind into the equatorial plane where it shocks, and (2) pre-main sequence stars \citep[Herbig Ae stars, e.g.][]{2004ApJ...614..221S,2020ApJ...888...15S,2007A&A...468..541T,2009A&A...494.1041G}, some of which even show magnetically collimated jets. Both classes are markedly different in magnetic properties and power sources available for X-ray generation and are not considered any further in this study.

In section~\ref{sec:data}, we show the data from those new observations. We discuss the results in section~\ref{sec:discussion} and summarize our findings in section~\ref{sec:summary}.


\section{Data analysis} \label{sec:data}
We observed four A-types stars with Chandra/HRC-I. Details of the observations are listed in Table~\ref{tab:obslog}. Data was reprocessed with CIAO 4.13 \citep{2006SPIE.6270E..1VF}, following standard analysis procedures.
For reproducibility, we provide the full analysis script\footnote{\url{https://github.com/hamogu/HottestCoolStar/blob/main/figures/HottestCoolStar.ipynb}}.

\begin{table*}
\caption{Chandra observations with pointing information \label{tab:obslog}}
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
\hline \hline

 &  &  & $\mathrm{{}^{\circ}}$ & $\mathrm{{}^{\circ}}$ & $\mathrm{ks}$ \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
First, we try to improve the astrometry of the Chandra observations.
The 90\% uncertainty circle for Chandra absolute astrometry is
0.8\arcsec\footnote{\url{https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/celmon/}}. Since
the relative precision is even better than that, the astrometry can be
improved if a sufficient number of sources can be matched to a catalog
with high astrometric precision. We run the CIAO task \texttt{wavdetect} on the
X-ray data to detect X-ray sources with the intent to cross-match them
with 2MASS \citep{2006AJ....131.1163S} or GAIA
\citep{2016A&A...595A...1G,2018A&A...616A...1G}.
In ObsID 18933, we find \object{2MASS J03021318-2335198}, a Seyfert~1 galaxy, to be located 0.7~arcsec to the East of the peak of the X-ray emission; in all other cases we do not find reliable, unambiguous matches or the matched sources are located so far from the aimpoint that their point-spread-function (PSF) is too large to improve coordinate accuracy.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chandra.pdf}
    \caption{Observations with the Chandra/HRC. The blue circles mark a 1~arcsec radius around the expected position of the target accounting for proper motion at the time of the observation. For $\tau^3$~Eri, the dotted circle accounts for the coordinate offset discussed in the text.
    \label{fig:chandra}}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:chandra} shows the Chandra/HRC-I images of our four
targets. A circle with 1~arcsec radius marks the position of the
target at the time of the observation. Coordinates and proper motions
are taken from \citet{2018yCat.1345....0G} for $\iota$~Cen and from
\cite{2007A&A...474..653V} for the remaining three targets. Only
$\tau^3$~Eri has significant emission within the marked circle in
Fig.~\ref{fig:chandra}. The expected position is about 0.7~arcsec to
the East of the peak of the X-ray emission; the direction and distance of
the offset are very similar to the offset detected in
2MASS~J03021318-2335198 and within the 90\% uncertainty expected for
the Chandra coordinates. We thus conclude that the apparent distance
is in fact due to the uncertainties of the Chandra coordinates and
that the source seen is a detection of $\tau^3$~Eri. 

Next, we determine source flux and uncertainties or upper limits.
We chose a source extraction region with 1.5~arcsec
radius to ensure that the source flux is captured even in the
presence of coordinate uncertainties. The Chandra
PSF depends on the photon energy, but for
soft sources as expected here, that region captures well above 95\%
of the PSF. Without knowing the source spectrum, we cannot fully
correct for the loss of photons outside the source aperture. For $\tau^3$~Eri, we calculate
uncertainties on the X-ray flux following a Bayesian approach that
takes into account the presence of a background following the method of \citet{1991ApJ...374..344K}. The background flux is determined from
a large region that is apparently source-free; in this way the
statistical error on the background rate is small.


However, there is a subtle difference between the upper end of a
confidence range and the upper limits for a detection. For those
sources that are undetected, we calculate the intensity that would be
required for an unambiguous detection. A source with 7 counts would be
detected with a significance of at least 99.7\% (corresponding to a
Gaussian-equivalent ``$3\sigma$'') with a probability of 0.5
\citep{2010ApJ...719..900K}.



Table~\ref{tab:detections} lists the detected count rate or upper limit. We convert the count rate into an energy flux, assuming a thermal spectrum. For Chandra/HRC-I,
1~ct~ks$^{-1}$ corresponds to an X-ray flux about $1.0*10^{-14}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-5~keV band according to WebPIMMS\footnote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3pimms/w3pimms.pl}}; the variation around this value is no more than 15\% in the temperature range 0.8-13~MK. Using the distance and bolometric luminosity from \citet{2002ApJ...579..800S}, Table~\ref{tab:detections} also lists $L_X$ and $\log(L_X/L_\mathrm{bol})$.
\begin{table*}

 & $\mathrm{ct}$ & $\mathrm{ct\,ks^{-1}}$ & $10^{-15}\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$ &  & $10^{26}\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ & $\mathrm{}$ \\

$\delta$ Leo & 0.0 ..  4.8 & 0.0 ..  0.5 & 0 .. 4.7 & $< -8.7$ & $2.1$ & $<-8.6$ \\
$\tau^3$ Eri & 20.5 .. 39.8 & 1.0 ..  2.0 & 10 ..   20 & -7.6 & ... & ... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}




All target stars are optically bright. We compare their $V$ magnitude
to Vega and scale the number of observed UV events from observations
of Vega \citep{2006ApJ...636..426P}. Based on this we expect 1 or fewer UV
events for each observation and we conclude that UV contamination is
negligible. For $\tau^3$ Eri, we checked the lightcurve and we do not find any significant variability, but --given the low-count number-- even a flare that doubles the X-ray output for a few ks could be hidden in the Poisson noise.


\section{Results and discussion}  \label{sec:discussion}
Our Chandra observations followed up on four targets where \cite{2002ApJ...579..800S} could only give upper limits from \emph{ROSAT} data. We detected $\tau^3$~Eri and pushed the upper limit on $L_X$ for $\delta$~Leo, $\beta$~Leo, and $\iota$~Cen down by about an order of magnitude (Table~\ref{tab:detections}). With that, there is now a one-to-one correspondence between X-ray emission and the transition region lines C\,{\sc iii} and O\,{\sc vi} lines which are formed between 50,000 and 300,000 K from the sample of \cite{2002ApJ...579..800S}. In the following, we put this finding in context with X-ray observations of other A-type stars in the literature (Table~\ref{tab}) and discuss implications in the light of other observational or theoretical work that has become available since the \cite{2002ApJ...579..800S} data was published.

Table~\ref{tab} compares fluxes and upper limits that we determine here to similar A-type stars from the literature.

\end{table*}

Note that ages given in the table are often based on membership in moving groups. In some cases, membership is under debate and stars could be considerably older if they turn out to be field stars, e.g., see the discussion and references in \citet{2021AJ....161..186D} for $\beta$~Leo. Table~\ref{tab} also gives a range of spectral types taken from the catalog of \citet{2014yCat....1.2023S} (see there for a full list of spectral type references). 
No single survey covers all stars in Table~\ref{tab} and it is well known that different classification methods lead to discrepant spectral types  \citep[e.g.,][]{1989ApJS...70..623G}.
Additionally, the surface of the stars in the table often cannot be described by a single spectral type or effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$; e.g.\ \citet{2010A&A...516A..38R} argued that the
spectral classification of HR~8799 of A5 is based on metal lines,
while the atmospheric temperature might be better characterized by its
hydrogen lines, which would make it an F0 star
\citep{1999AJ....118.2993G}, cool enough to generate magnetic activity
through a convective dynamo. Similarly,  Altair is a very fast rotator, and thus it has a considerable equatorial bulge and consequently lower effective temperature, which might allow the formation of a thin convection zone in that region \citep{2009A&A...497..511R}. Thus, the ordering in Table~\ref{tab} is by approximate spectral type from hot to cool, but the table does not list a unique effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ for every star. However, for those stars in the sample of \citet{2002ApJ...579..800S} we list the $T_\mathrm{eff}$ given in that work for comparison.

Numbers for the rotational velocity $v \sin i$ are also taken from a compilation \citep{2002A&A...393..897R}, since $\iota$ Cen is not part of the list, we use the value given in \cite{2002ApJ...579..800S}.

\subsection{Coronal temperatures}
It is difficult to constrain spectral properties of targets
that are undetected or have very few photons. We do however know
something about the later A-type stars in Table~\ref{tab}.  The X-ray
emission of \object{Altair}, spectral type around A7, shows modest
variability at the 30\% level due to stellar rotation. The plasma
temperature is around 1-4~MK \citep{2009A&A...497..511R}. 
$\beta$~Pic has an earlier spectral type of about A6 and still has weakly detected X-ray
emission \citep{2005A&A...440..727H,2012ApJ...750...78G} best
described by collisionally-excited optically thin emission with a temperature around 1.1~MK. The
spectrum of \object{HR 8799} is also soft with a temperature around
3~MK \citep{2010A\string&A...516A..38R}. We thus would expect any
X-ray emission from the other stars in Table~\ref{tab} to have an
equally soft spectrum. Due to the limited energy resolution of the HRC
we cannot perform a spectral fit to the new data from
$\tau^3$~Eri. Fortunately, the energy flux derived from HRC count
rates or upper limits is insensitive to the plasma temperature for
cool plasma (Section~\ref{sec:data}), so the fluxes and upper limits
given in Table~\ref{tab} depend only weakly on the exact plasma
temperature.


\subsection{Coronal and chromospheric activity}
\cite{2002ApJ...579..800S} detect the UV emission lines
of C~{\sc iii} at 977\AA{} and 1175\AA{} as well as the O~{\sc vi}
doublet 1032/1037\AA{} in single stars up to spectral type A4 (which
they associate with $T_\mathrm{eff}=8200$~K), but not in hotter stars. They also see those
lines in $\beta$~Ari, which has a primary component hotter than this
limit, but conclude that the most likely origin for the observed
emission is chromospheric activity in the cooler secondary in the
system. The emission lines of C~{\sc iii} and O~{\sc vi} are formed
below the corona; they have peak formation temperatures between
50,000~K and 300,000~K. Combining our new, more sensitive Chandra data with the X-ray data already discussed in \cite{2002ApJ...579..800S}, 
we now see a one-to-one correspondence between X-ray emission and
C~{\sc iii} and O~{\sc vi} lines in the single stars. This confirms that corona and chromosphere are powered by the same mechanism.
The drop in X-ray and UV activity is very sharp; the $L_X$/$L_{bol}$ value drops by
an order of magnitude between $\tau^3$~Eri and
$\beta$~Leo although they are classified with very similar spectral types in the literature (Table~\ref{tab}) and \citet{2002ApJ...579..800S} see a $\Delta T_\mathrm{eff} < 100$~K.

%\subsection{Debris disks}
Debris disks have been found in 
HR~4796A \citep[e.g.][]{1991ApJ...383L..79J}, Vega
\citep[e.g.][]{2005ApJ...628..487S}, $\iota$~Cen
\citep[e.g.][]{2011ApJ...736L..32Q}, $\beta$~Leo  \citep[e.g.][]{2021AJ....161..186D}, and
$\beta$~Pic \citep[e.g.][]{2001MNRAS.323..402L}.  These debris disks
form when planets or planetesimals in orbit around the star
collide. The smaller dust grains are blown out of the system through
radiation pressure relatively quickly and need to be replenished
constantly by grinding down larger objects. 
Some stars with debris disks have X-ray and transition region UV emission, others do not, so we conclude that the presence of debris disks is not the deciding factor for chromospheric or coronal activity.

%\subsection{Planets}
Since they are close and bright targets, the stars in Table~\ref{tab}
have also been targeted by planet searches. Massive planets are
confirmed for HR~8799 \citep{2008Sci...322.1348M} and $\beta$~Pic
\citep[e.g.][]{2021AJ....161..179B}, but they are located at several
AU distance from the star and are thus unlikely to influence the
X-ray emission from the star.

The deciding factor for detectability of X-ray and transition region UV seems to be the spectral type or effective temperature. As stars become hotter, the convective envelope shrinks and at some point the dynamo mechanism breaks down. At first sight, one might expect also a correlation with rotational velocities, where faster rotation produces a stronger X-ray activity as is clearly seen in lower mass main-sequence stars \citep{2011ApJ...743...48W}, but Table~\ref{tab} does not bear that out. $\tau^3$~Eri is seen in X-rays, while $\delta$~Leo and $\beta$~Leo are equally fast rotators, but slightly hotter and not detected in X-rays. Of course, the true rotation speed is unknown as long as we do not have the inclination angle $i$, but all three stars rotate close to the mean observed $v \sin i$ for their spectral type and only about a factor of 2-3 below the largest observed values \citep{1995ApJS...99..135A}, so they are unlikely to be observed close to pole-on.



\subsection{How could a dynamo operate in A-type stars?}
\label{sect:dynamos}

X-ray activity is common in later-type stars and for Altair
\citet{2009A&A...497..511R} concluded that the X-ray activity is
probably concentrated in the equatorial region, which is also
responsible for the generation of the chromosphere
\citep{1995ApJ...439.1011F}. Similar to Altair, $\tau^3$~Eri is also a
rapid rotator with $v\sin i=180$~km~s$^{-1}$ and an estimated oblateness
(depending on the inclination angle $i$) of around 7\%
\citep{2012A&ARv..20...51V}. On the other hand, $\delta$~Leo is an
equally fast rotator and remains undetected.

\citet{2019ApJ...883..106C} suggest the presence of 
convection zones in A and late B stars very close to the surface. These thin zones are caused
by partial ionization of H and He. For A-type stars about $10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ of the total $L_\mathrm{bol}$ is transported through convective motion. Assuming equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy, only $10^{-4}$ of the available magnetic energy would have to be converted into X-ray flux to power the observed X-ray luminosity. However, since the structure of those fields would differ markedly from the Sun, coronal heating would also look very different. Furthermore, \citet{2019ApJ...883..106C} predict that this mechanism should operate to mid-B type stars, in contrast to the drop of $L_X$/$L_{bol}$ that we observe in mid-A type stars in our sample.


%\subsubsection{Shear dynamos}
\citet{2014ApJ...786..136D} extensively discuss two types of shear
dynamos that could transform some initial differential rotation of a
young star into a magnetic field that quickly decays, on time scales
of order of a Myr for a dynamo based on magnetic buoyancy
\citep{1995MNRAS.272..528T} or on times scales of order 300~yr for a
dynamo based on the Taylor instability
\citep{2002A&A...381..923S,2006A&A...449..451B}. Both scenarios
involve physical parameters that are uncertain by orders of magnitude
and \citet{2014ApJ...786..136D} use their upper limit on the X-ray
flux from HR~4796A to exclude the most optimistic values for those
parameters. Our limit for $\beta$~Leo is significantly stricter, but
the star is also older (Table~\ref{tab}), which places about the same
limits on the parameters for the \citet{1995MNRAS.272..528T} model as
does HR~4796A \citep[See Fig 3 in][]{2014ApJ...786..136D}.

Rapid rotation leads to a bulged and cooler equator in these stars \citep[on Altair][resolved a temperature difference between pole and equator of at least 1000~K]{2007Sci...317..342M}, so one may speculate that some of the stars might be conducive to a convective instability near their equators as has been suggested by \citet{2009A&A...497..511R} for Altair. If so, then a convective dynamo near their equator may sustain significant levels of magnetic activity. Since the X-ray activity is becoming appreciable starting at $\tau^3$~Eri, it suggests that $\tau^3$~Eri and cooler stars are in an appropriate regime to host equatorial convection. 

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
We present Chandra/HRC-I observations of four early A stars. $\tau^3$~Eri is clearly detected, while we set sensitive upper limits on the other three targets. With this detection and our new upper limits that are an order of magnitude better than previous \emph{ROSAT} data, there is now a one-to-one correspondence between X-ray emission and C\,{\sc iii} and O\,{\sc vi} lines formed between 50,000 and 300,000 K in the transition region \citep{2002ApJ...579..800S}. This confirms that both regions are powered by the same physical mechanism and that this mechanism essentially switches off between spectral types A3 and A4 (around $T_\mathrm{eff}=8200$~K) as we observe a drop of X-ray luminosity by at least an order of magnitude. Given the age of $\tau^3$~Eri, which we detect, the magnetic field that powers X-ray emission and UV lines needs to be generated continuously. We discuss different dynamo mechanisms that could power the observed X-ray emission, but we are unable to conclusively select any particular one.
